## Project Description

<br />
The StarbucksToken is a tokenized rewards program that allows companies to create custom-branded rewards tokens that can be distributed to customers upon purchase. Customers can then exchange these tokens for tokens from other participating companies or use them to make purchases at their stores. The program is designed to provide customers with more flexible and transparent rewards options, while also benefiting participating companies through increased customer engagement and loyalty. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, the program can provide greater security, transparency, and decentralization compared to traditional rewards programs.


The StarbucksToken contract uses the BEP-20 standard to create a tokenized rewards program for Starbucks. 

This token is named "Starbucks Token," with the symbol "SBUX".

The contract has three main functions: transfer, approve, and transferFrom.

The transfer function allows users to send StarbucksTokens to other users, while also deducting a 1% fee and sending it to a fee collector contract.
The approve function allows users to approve other users to spend a specified amount of StarbucksTokens on their behalf.
The transferFrom function allows those approved users to actually spend those tokens.
In addition to these functions, the contract also has a balanceOf function that allows users to check their token balance and an allowance function that allows users to check how much of their tokens have been approved for spending by others.

Customer Engagement
